# QuickScore Demo

[![GitHub Pages][gh-pages-badge]][gh-pages]

This is a demo of the [QuickScore](https://github.com/fwextensions/quick-score) string-scoring and fuzzy-matching library, which is based on the Quicksilver algorithm and is designed for smart auto-complete.  The demo lets you auto-complete your query against a few hundred bookmarks (title and URL) and to compare the results and speed against these string matching libraries:

* Fuse.js
* fuzzysort
* liquidmetal
* match-sorter
* original Quicksilver algorithm

The UI is built with React, but the [QuickScore](https://github.com/fwextensions/quick-score) library itself doesn't require it and has no dependencies.
